IMPORTANT NOTICE
----------------

2012-10-16: The files intact-clustered.txt and intact-clustered.zip are not generated in psimitab folder anymore. They have been replaced with 
            intact-micluster.txt, intact-micluster_negative.txt, intact-micluster.zip.
2012-09-04: The current files intact-clustered.txt and intact-clustered.zip are now deprecated and will be soon entirely replaced with 
            intact-micluster.txt and intact-micluster.zip. The current intact-clustered.txt file is based on MITAB 25 INTACT expanded format 
            which is now deprecated. The new clustered mitab file will be based on MITAB 25 and will be a summary of all unique detection methods, 
            publications, interaction types reported per unique binary pair in IntAct. If you have any questions about this change, please contact 
            us on intact-help@ebi.ac.uk.
2009-08-27: From now on, each line of intact.txt will only refer to a single interaction evidence. 
            In the past we used to aggregate all evidences for a given pair of molecules in a single 
            line, it will now appears as multiple MITAB line. APIs such as intact-psimitab 2.1.0 and
            psimitab-parser 1.7.6 do reflect this change.  


The MITAB27 format is part of the PSI-MI standard [1]. The format is fully described at https://code.google.com/p/psicquic/wiki/MITAB27Format.
It has been derived from the tabular format provided by BioGrid. 
MITAB27 only describes binary interactions, one pair of interactors per row. 
Columns are separated by tabulations.

SOFTWARE
--------

The PSI-MI workgroup has developed a parser for PSIMITAB, more information can be found on the PSI web site [2].
Should you need more information about it, contact us [3]
