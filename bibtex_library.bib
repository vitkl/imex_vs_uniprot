	Abstract = {Information on protein-protein interactions is of central importance for many areas of biomedical research. At present no method exists to systematically and experimentally assess the quality of individual interactions reported in interaction mapping experiments. To provide a standardized confidence-scoring method that can be applied to tens of thousands of protein interactions, we have developed an interaction tool kit consisting of four complementary, high-throughput protein interaction assays. We benchmarked these assays against positive and random reference sets consisting of well documented pairs of interacting human proteins and randomly chosen protein pairs, respectively. A logistic regression model was trained using the data from these reference sets to combine the assay outputs and calculate the probability that any newly identified interaction pair is a true biophysical interaction once it has been tested in the tool kit. This general approach will allow a systematic and empirical assignment of confidence scores to all individual protein-protein interactions in interactome networks.},

@article{Mellacheruvu:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS) is a widely used approach for the identification of protein-protein interactions. However, for any given protein of interest, determining which of the identified polypeptides represent bona fide interactors versus those that are background contaminants (for example, proteins that interact with the solid-phase support, affinity reagent or epitope tag) is a challenging task. The standard approach is to identify nonspecific interactions using one or more negative-control purifications, but many small-scale AP-MS studies do not capture a complete, accurate background protein set when available controls are limited. Fortunately, negative controls are largely bait independent. Hence, aggregating negative controls from multiple AP-MS studies can increase coverage and improve the characterization of background associated with a given experimental protocol. Here we present the contaminant repository for affinity purification (the CRAPome) and describe its use for scoring protein-protein interactions. The repository (currently available for Homo sapiens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and computational tools are freely accessible at http://www.crapome.org/.},

	Abstract = {The evidence that two molecules interact in a living cell is often inferred from multiple different experiments. Experimental data is captured in multiple repositories, but there is no simple way to assess the evidence of an interaction occurring in a cellular environment. Merging and scoring of data are commonly required operations after querying for the details of specific molecular interactions, to remove redundancy and assess the strength of accompanying experimental evidence. We have developed both a merging algorithm and a scoring system for molecular interactions based on the proteomics standard initiative-molecular interaction standards. In this manuscript, we introduce these two algorithms and provide community access to the tool suite, describe examples of how these tools are useful to selectively present molecular interaction data and demonstrate a case where the algorithms were successfully used to identify a systematic error in an existing dataset.},

@article{Zhang:2011aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The identification of genes responsible for human inherited diseases is one of the most challenging tasks in human genetics. Recent studies based on phenotype similarity and gene proximity have demonstrated great success in prioritizing candidate genes for human diseases. However, most of these methods rely on a single protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to calculate similarities between genes, and thus greatly restrict the scope of application of such methods. Meanwhile, independently constructed and maintained PPI networks are usually quite diverse in coverage and quality, making the selection of a suitable PPI network inevitable but difficult. METHODS: We adopt a linear model to explain similarities between disease phenotypes using gene proximities that are quantified by diffusion kernels of one or more PPI networks. We solve this model via a Bayesian approach, and we derive an analytic form for Bayes factor that naturally measures the strength of association between a query disease and a candidate gene and thus can be used as a score to prioritize candidate genes. This method is intrinsically capable of integrating multiple PPI networks. RESULTS: We show that gene proximities calculated from PPI networks imply phenotype similarities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Bayesian regression approach on five PPI networks via large scale leave-one-out cross-validation experiments and summarize the results in terms of the mean rank ratio of known disease genes and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We further show the capability of our approach in integrating multiple PPI networks. CONCLUSIONS: The Bayesian regression approach can achieve much higher performance than the existing CIPHER approach and the ordinary linear regression method. The integration of multiple PPI networks can greatly improve the scope of application of the proposed method in the inference of disease genes.},

	Abstract = {MAPPIT (MAmmalian Protein-Protein Interaction Trap) is a two-hybrid technology that facilitates the detection and analysis of interactions between proteins in living mammalian cells. The system is based on type 1 cytokine receptor signaling. The bait protein of interest is fused to a chimeric signaling-deficient cytokine receptor, the signaling competence of which is restored upon recruitment of a prey protein that is coupled to a functional cytokine receptor domain. MAPPIT exhibits an excellent signal-to-noise ratio, detects a wide variety of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) including transient and indirect interactions, and has been shown to be highly complementary to other two-hybrid methods with respect to the interactions it can detect. Variants of the method were developed to allow large-scale PPI screening, mapping of protein interaction interfaces, PPI inhibitor screening and drug profiling. This chapter describes a basic 4-day MAPPIT protocol for the analysis of interaction between two designated proteins.},

	Abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play an integral role in numerous cellular processes. Membrane protein interactions, in particular, are critical in cellular responses to stresses and stimuli, with dysfunction of these PPIs (e.g., due to aberrant expression and/or mutation of interaction partners) leading to a diverse array of pathological states. Exploration of the interaction space and dynamics of membrane proteins is difficult due to the limitations of current techniques used to study proteins in the biochemically complex environment of biological membranes. In the protocols below, we describe a newly developed membrane protein interaction assay called the Mammalian-Membrane Two-Hybrid (MaMTH), designed specifically for the detection of integral membrane PPIs in the context of living mammalian cells. Prior to using MaMTH, cell lines of interest are genetically modified to encode a reporter of choice. MaMTH "bait" and "prey" constructs of interest are also generated using Gateway cloning technology. The assay is then performed by co-transfection of baits and preys, with bait-prey interaction quantifiably assessed by way of a reporter signal (e.g., light (luciferase), fluorescence (GFP).

IntAct has developed a sophisticated web-based curation tool, capable of supporting both IMEx- and MIMIx-level curation. This tool is now utilized by multiple additional curation teams, all of whom annotate data directly into the IntAct database. Members of the IntAct team supply appropriate levels of training, perform quality control on entries and take responsibility for long-term data maintenance. Recently, the MINT and IntAct databases decided to merge their separate efforts to make optimal use of limited developer resources and maximize the curation output. All data manually curated by the MINT curators have been moved into the IntAct database at EMBL-EBI and are merged with the existing IntAct dataset. Both IntAct and MINT are active contributors to the IMEx consortium (http://www.imexconsortium.org).},

	Abstract = {The organization of a cell emerges from the interactions in protein networks. The interactome is critically dependent on the strengths of interactions and the cellular abundances of the connected proteins, both of which span orders of magnitude. However, these aspects have not yet been analyzed globally. Here, we have generated a library of HeLa cell lines expressing 1,125 GFP-tagged proteins under near-endogenous control, which we used as input for a next-generation interaction survey. Using quantitative proteomics, we detect specific interactions, estimate interaction stoichiometries, and measure cellular abundances of interacting proteins. These three quantitative dimensions reveal that the protein network is dominated by weak, substoichiometric interactions that play a pivotal role in defining network topology. The minority of stable complexes can be identified by their unique stoichiometry signature. This study provides a rich interaction dataset connecting thousands of proteins and introduces a framework for quantitative network analysis.},

@article{Schaefer:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks are associated with multiple types of biases partly rooted in technical limitations of the experimental techniques. Another source of bias are the different frequencies with which proteins have been studied for interaction partners. It is generally believed that proteins with a large number of interaction partners tend to be essential, evolutionarily conserved, and involved in disease. It has been repeatedly reported that proteins driving tumor formation have a higher number of PPI partners. However, it has been noticed before that the degree distribution of PPI networks is biased toward disease proteins, which tend to have been studied more often than non-disease proteins. At the same time, for many poorly characterized proteins no interactions have been reported yet. It is unclear to which extent this study bias affects the observation that cancer proteins tend to have more PPI partners. Here, we show that the degree of a protein is a function of the number of times it has been screened for interaction partners. We present a randomization-based method that controls for this bias to decide whether a group of proteins is associated with significantly more PPI partners than the proteomic background. We apply our method to cancer proteins and observe, in contrast to previous studies, no conclusive evidence for a significantly higher degree distribution associated with cancer proteins as compared to non-cancer proteins when we compare them to proteins that have been equally often studied as bait proteins. Comparing proteins from different tumor types, a more complex picture emerges in which proteins of certain cancer classes have significantly more interaction partners while others are associated with a smaller degree. For example, proteins of several hematological cancers tend to be associated with a higher number of interaction partners as expected by chance. Solid tumors, in contrast, are usually associated with a degree distribution similar to those of equally often studied random protein sets. We discuss the biological implications of these findings. Our work shows that accounting for biases in the PPI network is possible and increases the value of PPI data.},

	Abstract = {A major goal of proteomics is the complete description of the protein interaction network underlying cell physiology. A large number of small scale and, more recently, large-scale experiments have contributed to expanding our understanding of the nature of the interaction network. However, the necessary data integration across experiments is currently hampered by the fragmentation of publicly available protein interaction data, which exists in different formats in databases, on authors' websites or sometimes only in print publications. Here, we propose a community standard data model for the representation and exchange of protein interaction data. This data model has been jointly developed by members of the Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI), a work group of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO), and is supported by major protein interaction data providers, in particular the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database (BIND), Cellzome (Heidelberg, Germany), the Database of Interacting Proteins (DIP), Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA, USA), the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD), Hybrigenics (Paris, France), the European Bioinformatics Institute's (EMBL-EBI, Hinxton, UK) IntAct, the Molecular Interactions (MINT, Rome, Italy) database, the Protein-Protein Interaction Database (PPID, Edinburgh, UK) and the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany).},
