#All unique genes in selected ontologies: 17925 (reference set for hypergeometric test)

#Genes from Cluster#1: uploaded ids 8642 -> unique genes 8587, with 9 (0.1%) missing  -> 8578 recognized by ClueGO.
#Genes from Cluster#2: uploaded ids 11574 -> unique genes 11541, with 15 (0.13%) missing  -> 11526 recognized by ClueGO.
 -> To improve the % of found genes, verify gene identifiers, download new available ClueGO conversion files or add/request additional files.

#Genes with functional annotations in all selected Ontologies from Cluster#1: 8194 (95.52%) -> 384 (4.48%) are not functionally annotated in any selected Ontology!
#Genes with functional annotations in all selected Ontologies from Cluster#2: 10858 (94.2%) -> 668 (5.8%) are not functionally annotated in any selected Ontology!
#Unique genes with functional annotations in all selected ontologies from the 2 Clusters: 12645 (62.9%) -> 7459 (37.1%) are not functionally annotated!
 -> To improve the % of annotated genes, chose additional ontologies or define less restrictive selection criteria.

#Genes from all Clusters associated to representative Terms and Pathways (after applying selection criteria): 12454 (61.95%)
